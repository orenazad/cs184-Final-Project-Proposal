    <h3 align="middle">Abstract</h3>

    <p>
        The primary goal of this project was to extend CS184's path tracer to support beautifully rendering minecraft
        worlds and small builds by importing minecraft scenes into the path tracer. Our first task was to create a proof
        of concept and import all the diffuse (base color) materials and geometry into our pathtracer. We used
        <i>assimp</i> to load in the files,
        vertices, and textures. To load in the geometry and textures we successfully refactored much of the projects
        scene creation system,
        worked on UV mapping, and developed many other bells and whistles needed to use textures in the pathtracer
        effeciently. From here, we worked on loading in
        full scenes with lighting and camera through COLLADA files, and which required rewriting the pathtracers camera
        class. With the much of the work done for to be able to load in large scenes, cameras, lights, textures, and
        materials, we moved on to Physically Based Rendering. Minecraft has 4 different PBR maps that: Normal Map,
        Roughness Map, Emissive Map, and a Metallic map. We incorporated all of these into one large PBRBSDF which is
        efficiently created for each pixel on a texture and shared across an entire mesh. Now we can render some pretty
        images!
    </p>


    <h3 align="middle">Technical Approach</h3>

    <h4 align="middle"> Summary </h4>

    <p>
        We started by making sure that we can load in geometry and textures. To do this, we used both the course's
        COLLADA file, and our own OBJ and MTL files. To do so, we use a program called Mineways to export Minecraft
        worlds as OBJ and MTL files. Later, we can bring these files into Blender to re-export them as COLLADA files,
        and setup the camera, lights, etc. So, we used the courses Cornell Box model, and brought our minecraft model
        together, loading separate things from both. With this, we could work on the main work needed, UV mapping and
        textures for the pathtracer. At first, we simply returned a diffuseBSDF with the color of the sampled pixel on
        the texture at the point of intersection. We also had to make sure to sample the texture's alpha values to make
        sure we don't count intersections where the texture is completely clear. In order to achieve all this, we
        created a new Primitive, called <i>Textured Triangle</i>, which holds texture coordinates, the texture, and has
        a different intersection function in order to calculate the exact point of intersection and return the correct
        color. We used Open Asset Import Library <i>assimp</i> to load our OBJ and MTL files, and later we used this to
        load in the full COLLADA file. At this step, we also rewrote the TexturedTriangles <code>draw()</code> function
        to use textures, allowing us to get a rasterized preview of the scene! This was super useful throughout the
        project.

    <h4 align="middle"> Problems </h4>

    <p>
        The main problems we encountered during this first part of the project were refactoring code to use
        <i>assimp's</i>
        functions and variables and implementing textures when images are imported upside down. We spent extensive time
        reading
        through <i> assimp </i> documentation to integrate assimp into the project 3-1 Pathtracer. The OBJ files we were
        given
        put the y coordinate of 0 at the bottom instead of the top so when we applied texture mapping the textures would
        be upside down.
        To fix this we used the STB image library to flip images vertically on load.

    </p>
    <h5 align="middle"> Metallic Maps </h5>

    <p>One issue we ran into was Minecraft's <i>Metallic Maps</i>. From Microsoft, we know that tetallic maps are are a
        grayscale texture which at each pixel, determines how metallic the block is. However, this concept doesn't
        really fit into the Microfacet BSDF model, and there is an extreme lack of documentation on how Microsoft and
        NVIDIA actually use the metallic map themselves. The key problem is that in our Microfacet model, we use a
        Complex IOR to represent different metals. Which one should be used to represent all these different pixels on
        the Metallic map? No information is provided as to what metal should be used at a certain pixel, and there is no
        method of converting from a diffuse color to the complex IOR needed to represent it. So, we decided to use a
        bunch of known complex IOR values and default to those. Anything that contains the world "gold", for example,
        uses gold's IOR. This is done for Copper and Iron as well. However, this can't catch all cases. For example,
        look at the picture of the crafting table below.
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/final/crafting_table.jp2" align="middle" width="800px" />
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Notice the metallic look of the tools on the side! These are the cool details that make for beautiful images. In
        order to implement these, we continue with using a known set of complex IOR values, but map that to a range of
        RGB values. For each metallic pixel on a texuture that doesn't contain a keyword, we find whichever RGB and IOR
        pair is closest to the sampled diffuse color at that pixel. This allows for small details, like copper or iron
        accents on various textures to be rendered correctly!</p>

    <h5 align="middle"> File Format Fun </h5>

    <p>There were many considerations to take into account when choosing a file format. Our first implementation used
        OBJ and MTL for the geometry, and COLLADA for the lights and camera. However, we wanted one file to rule them
        all! This discarded OBJ and MTL off that bat, as they didn't support camera or lights. We looked into several
        other options, like COLLADA, FBX, USD, and GLTF 2.0. Here, we see some of the real-world problems with different
        formats. For example, <i>assimp</i> doesn't support all of GLTF's extensions, which meant no lights for us. USD
        sounds like it could be great, but <i>assimp</i> couldn't open that either! Since COLLADA doesn't support PBR
        materials, this only left us with FBX. However, after implementing it, we found the <i>assimp's</i> FBX loader
        has some bugs in it. This left us with COLLADA. Luckily, since Minecraft textures have a smart naming scheme, we
        realized we didn't need COLLADA to support PBR. The PBR textures in minecraft are all named identically to their
        diffuse texture, except with an additional suffix. We could load the diffuse texture path through the COLLADA
        file and look for the PBR textures ourselves! <i>assimp's</i> COLLADA implementation still had some bugs though.
        For example, it couldn't properly parse area lights from COLLADA files, and read them as point lights instead.
        We had to develop some work arounds for this, but it was a good lesson in balancing what makes sense in theory,
        verse real-world issues and complications.

    <h4 align="middle"> Lessons Learned </h4>

    <p>
        In the first project we learned about importing info from OBJ and MTL files using the Open Asset Import Library.
        Additionally, we learned about implementing UV mapping and textures using the information from <i>assimp</i>.
