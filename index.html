    <h1 align="middle">Final Project: Minecraft Path Tracing and PBR Renderer</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Oren Azad, Omer Sasson, Varun Srivastava, Arthur Pan</h2>
    <h3 align="middle">Website Link: https://orenazad.github.io/cs184-Final-Project-Proposal/</h3>

    <h3 align="middle">Summary</h3>

    <p>The primary goal of this project is to extend CS184's path tracer to support beautifully rendering minecraft
        worlds and small builds. Ideally, the path tracer is able to handle intricate and small scenes with a high level
        of detail and light quality, but we would also potentially like to investigate support for wider scenes of
        several minecraft chunks to display landscapes.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>

    <p>We enjoyed working on the Path Tracer and seeing beautifully rendered final results. We thought it would be great
        to be able to extend the functionality of the path tracer with texture support, but also wanted to render
        something cool that we could be excited about. Rendering our own minecraft builds also gives the ability to
        easily create scenes ourselves and bring them to life in the Path Tracer. Additionally, latest versions of
        Minecraft have included real-time Path Tracing, so PBR texturepacks for Minecraft are widespread. We will be
        able to use these texture packs to add more than just texture functionality, but also things like metallic and
        roughness maps! Finally, Minecraft without shaders is quite static and boring lighting-wise, and it would be
        exciting to see it in a <i>new light</i>.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Much of the nuance in this project will be in the full details of PBR. Minecraft texture packs typically have 5
        additional maps on top of the texture itself:
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Metallic Map</li>
        <li>Emissive Map</li>
        <li>Roughness Map</li>
        <li>Normal Map</li>
        <li>Height Map - Typically unused in wake of Normal Maps.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    In particular, Emissive maps stand out as something that could be quite difficult to extend to our path tracer.

    <br><br>
    Further, we will also need to make sure we can properly import all this data in the first place. This will
    require us to extend the COLLADA parser that is already there, or replace it will a new library such as <i>
        assimp</i> or <i>tinyobj</i>. Additionally, Minecraft has many blocks with lighting in specific manners. For
    example, the new candle blocks. Without knowing how exactly our tools will import this, it is unlikely we will
    be able to handle every configuration automatically, and some work will need to be done in blender before
    rendering.
    <br>

    Finally, if feasible beyond the workload of the rest of the project we would like to investigate some sort of
    larger rendering capability. We feel that this may be difficult due to Minecraft's current method of global
    lighting. There will need to be some sort of light done to replicate the sun's in-game lighting.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h3>

    <p>The primary goal of this project is to extend the Path Tracer with textures, and ideally PBR texture packs. The
        goal is to be able to create pleasing images of Minecraft world's or builds that we wouldn't be able to see
        otherwise. Since Minecraft typically hasn't been a path traced game, lighting effects like reflection,
        refraction, depth of field, and non-block-based lighting would be an entirely new way to view builds. We hope to
        create images like the two (primarily the first) below:
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/Zak_Fynn-Winter_Ambience.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px" />
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/firehart-Mountain_forest_TIMG.jpg" align="middle" width="400px" />
                </td>
            </tr>
            <br>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>In the first image, notice everything that isn't there in Minecraft. Depth of field, lighting and shadows that
        actually makes sense (notice the left side of the lectern,where the half-slab casts a tiny shadow). The shadow
        of the plant on the wall, and the candles reflecting in the glass.</p>

    <p>Its tough to say how we may evaluate the results out of the Path Tracer, other than "by looks". However, one goal
        we can keep in mind is to keep the project performant, and also to stylistically not drag ourselves to far away
        from what we expect Minecraft to look like.</p>

    <p> To summarize, what we plan to deliver: A Path Tracer that is able to render small but detailed scenes like the
        first image above. In order to do this, we need to first and foremost build the infrastructure to import and
        support minecraft builds and lighting into the renderer. Then, we must build support for regular texture maps.
        Finally, we will add support for PBR texture maps where possible, such as metallic maps and roughness maps. We
        plan to add emissive maps aswell but see this as having the potential to be a larger problem than expected.
        Importantly, we would like to do all of this while keeping the program performant.
    </p>

    <p>If all goes well: Add support for more blocks that might be more complicated, such as water or . This wouldn't be
        similiar to raytracing an actual water material physically, as we aim to keep the style of minecraft. Still, it
        would be additional work. Further, we would also like to look into some sort of global illumination in order to
        be able to render larger scenes that don't have actual lights placed everywhere, such as landscapes.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Schedule</h3>
    <p>
    <uL>
        <li>
            Week 1:
            - Implement functionality in order to import DAE or OBJ files from Minecraft worlds.
            - Start Implementing Textures into the Path Tracer, this can be done in parallel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Week 2:
            - Finish Texture maps.
            - Move onto support for PBR maps, such as normals, roughness, metallic, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Week 3:
            - Finish PBR maps, specifically nuanced points like glass materials and so on.
            - Work on emissive maps and overall lighting to make improvements where possible and use a variety of
            different
            light sources from minecraft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Week 4:
            - Wrap up any issues we run into, polish where needed (again, small details like the textures behind lights
            on
            candles and so on)
            - Investigate possible stretch goals.
        </li>
    </uL>
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Resources</h3>

    <p>Luckily, there are plenty of good resources on Path tracing out there. In fact, Microsoft has published some
        specifics on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/rtxpbrintro">PBR in
            Minecraft</a>. Additionally, a few Minecraft path-tracers exist already, such as <a
            href="https://chunky-dev.github.io/gallery/">Chunky</a>. These may be useful in navigating Minecraft
        specific nuances, like how certain textures or models work. There are also some free books available on PBR such
        as <a href="https://pbrt.org/">PBRT</a>. Finally, there are also many resources available form other courses
        (and our own!) on Path Tracing and specifically using Textures, <a
            href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4620/2017sp/slides/06rt-textures.pdf">such as these slides from
            Cornell's CS4620</a>.

        In terms of software, we can use software such as <a
            href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/">Mineways</a> to turn Minecraft
        builds or worlds into OBJ files that can be imported in to Blender. From there, we can make any neccessary
        changes and export them as COLLADA files for import into the Path Tracer. Since we are extending Project 3's
        pathtracer, the computing platform will be MacOS and Windows. We don't expect renders to take substantially
        longer, so our laptops should suffice, but we will also have access to more powerful hardware like a Ryzen 9
        5950x for final renders.
