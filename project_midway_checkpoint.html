    <h2 align="middle">Oren Azad, Omer Sasson, Varun Srivastava, Arthur Pan</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Accomplishments so far</h3>

    <p>The primary goal of this project is to extend CS184's path tracer to support rendering minecraft
        worlds and small builds by importing minecraft scenes into the path tracer. We are currently able 
        to load in images from the minecraft meshing int our pathtracer. This took a lot of effort and 
        we had to use assimp to read the obj files and import the vertices. After importing the vertices 
        we had to create our own triangle meshes switching from assimp 3D vector points to our own
        Vector3D arrays. Second, we were able to load in textures and apply them to images from Minecraft. 
        We had to do our own calcualtions for the textured coordinates to ensure we were correctly applying textures.  </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h3>

    <p> As you can see we are able to load the image in the cornell box but we are having trouble loading in 
        the lights so we need to find a way to load in the lights since obj files only contain vertices and faces.

    <h3 align="middle"> Reflection and updating Roadmap </h3>

    <p>
        We have been able to implement the functionality to import OBJ files from Minecraft as we wanted to in week 1. 
        Yet, we have been struggling to fix the issues of dealing with lights and the camera with the built in collad parser from 
        project 3-1. This caused issues and has led us to be a bit behind schedule since we are working on fixing this issue. Luckily, 
        we have been able to work on implementing textured maps and have got that to work. Which is what we wanted to finish by week 2. 
        We plan on continuing to fix the lighting and file problems, and hope to start on implementing PBR maps to get highly realistic images.
        We are mainly on schedule but have fallen behind about a week so it seems unlikely we will be able to hit our stretch goals that 
        we first set in our project proposal. 
        
        Our new updated plan is to be able to fix the file formatting issues so we can introduce our own lights and camera in the next couple days. 
        Then, we plan on implementing more textures so we can create PBR images.
